Short term:
When [a,b]=[-10,10], endpoint SD paths don't appear to get created correctly.
a or b complex causes errors

med term:
-Change adjaceny matrix approach to a cost-function type approach to find SD path
-Rather than two standard Gaussian splits for finite paths, more involved parametrisation can cover both. This also avoids the bodge in the finite path detection algorithm.s
- change number of quadrature points to reflect stationary points

Long term:
3. Detect if integrand is/isn't oscillatory
5. Account for g(x)=x^(1/2)~type branch cuts
