Short term:
When [a,b]=[-10,10], endpoint SD paths don't appear to get created correctly.
a or b complex causes errors

Long term:
-1. Detect poles in complex plane
-2. Allow phase g(x) to be complex, or have singularities/poles
3. Detect if integrand is/isn't oscillatory
5. Account for g(x)=x^(1/2)~type branch cuts
6. If analytic, can stop early when have found one stationary point of order one in a rectangle
