Short term:
1. Improve root finding algorithm
2. Find the bug which causes that \epsilon-issue
3. Split code up into sensible components
4. Write test file for particularly nasty cases


Long term:
1. Detect poles in complex plane.
2. Allow phase g(x) to be complex, or have singularities/poles
3. Detect if integrand is/isn't oscillatory
4. Split into continuous chunks using Chebfun
5. Account for g(x)=x^(1/2) branch cuts
